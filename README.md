# safesteps-hardware: Hardware Repo for XC475 Safesteps Team!

## About
- Tech Stack + Deps:
  - Arduino IDE
  - ESP32
  - ArduinoBLE.h

## Setup
- Using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), you can load each script in src and upload it to the ESP. Make sure that you have the correct board configurations selected: ESP32-WROOM-DA Module on /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART (works on my machine, but the configuration could depend based on your local machine)
- Upload the script. Once uploaded, the arduino will run the script every time it is plugged in.

## Examples
- Note: code examples that we based our work off of do not belong to us. The original files are included in this repo without any changes made, OG contributors can be found in each file

## src
- Contains source code for the server app iterations.
